##   Yarn
We use yarn because it is determisting just as npm shrink wrap,i.e in whatever  machine you run code
it runs exactly the same way.


#### Angular(or so called mvc) vs React
Orignally mvc was designed for server which was working wonderfully.
Then people decided to use this flow on clint side,they created modals views controller seperated.

But this was not ideal for clint side so people at facebook desided to use some concepts of  encaputations
and created component based liberary.
This proved to be a wonderfull idea,becuse it is easer to maintain as everything is encpsulated insied components,easier to
reuse.But it comes with a cost of writting more code.
